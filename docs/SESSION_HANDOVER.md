> Created: 2026-03-02 | Updated: 2026-03-08 20:20 CST | Conversation: b67d2a36-ae6c-4b3b-a755-c53587c4407e

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEXT SESSION

Read this file FIRST. It contains everything you need to continue the HLF delta analysis and SAFE backfill work without repeating research.

## 1. What Was Done This Session

### SAFE v4.0 Backfill (Multi-Pass Verified)
- Ran 5 independent NotebookLM sessions against the SAFE v4.0 Blueprint
- Cross-referenced results to filter hallucinations
- Saved **9 notes** to the Swarm Identity Core notebook
- Created corrective notes for: 7-Layer↔13-Layer mapping, MAESTRO deep details, EGL convergence (was wrongly classified as hallucination — IT IS REAL)

### HLF v0.2 → v0.4.0 Delta Analysis
- Analyzed 6 key codebase files: `hlfc.py` (1106 lines), `hls.yaml` (385 lines), `TODO.md` (344 lines), `Sovereign_OS_Master_Build_Plan.md` (994 lines), `HLF_GRAMMAR_REFERENCE.md`, `HLF_PROGRESS.md`
- Cataloged every statement type, operator, grammar rule, compiler pass added between v0.2 and v0.4.0
- Cross-referenced against TODO.md to ensure accuracy of "built vs not built" classifications

### Key Corrections Made
1. **EGL (Evolutionary Generality Loss)** — Previously dismissed as hallucination noise. CONFIRMED REAL from SAFE Blueprint with formal math: Theorems 5.1/5.2, DGM, Yunjue pipeline. NOT YET BUILT in codebase.
2. **Hieroglyphic foundations** — Not aesthetic branding. Core design principles from academic paper "Context-Aware Translation of Egyptian Hieroglyphs via Symbol Segmentation, Classification, and Retrieval-Augmented LLMs". Four pillars: Symbol Taxonomy (Gardiner→MetaGlyphs), Spatial Organization (Quadrats→Nested Logic), Contextual Understanding (FAISS RAG→Two-Channel), Interpretability (LLM narrative→InsAIts V2).
3. **Build status under-counted** — Many items initially marked "NOT BUILT" are actually complete: runtime interpreter (639 lines), host function dispatcher (305 lines), full 6-gate security pipeline, all governance configs, bytecode_spec.yaml (spec exists).

## 2. Key Files to Read

### Gap Analysis (THE primary artifact)
- `C:\Users\gerry\.gemini\antigravity\brain\17bf5fb7-8201-4b97-b2db-5f9e35e348ef\gap_analysis.md`

### Project Build Docs

- `Sovereign_OS_Master_Build_Plan.md` — Original architecture spec (994 lines, v0.2 baseline)
- `docs/HLF_PROGRESS.md` — Progress tracking for Jules agent sync
- `docs/HLF_GRAMMAR_REFERENCE.md` — Authoritative operator catalog

### HLF Compiler & Grammar
- `hlf/hlfc.py` — 1106-line compiler with full grammar (lines 25-130), transformer (135-553), 4-pass pipeline (617-end)
- `governance/hls.yaml` — Machine-readable BNF (385 lines, v0.4.0)
- `governance/templates/dictionary.json` — 16 typed tag signatures
- `governance/ALIGN_LEDGER.yaml` — 8 security rules (R-001 to R-008)

### Walkthrough
- `C:\Users\gerry\.gemini\antigravity\brain\17bf5fb7-8201-4b97-b2db-5f9e35e348ef\walkthrough.md`

## 3. NotebookLM Notebooks

### Swarm Identity Core (299 sources)
- **URL:** `https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/13b9e9f1-77aa-4eba-8760-e38dbdc98bdc`
- **9 notes saved this session:**
  1. SAFE v4.0 — Verified 13-Layer Architecture Reference
  2. SAFE v4.0 — Verified MAESTRO + ETHOS + Key Frameworks
  3. Agent Programming Language Blueprint — Verified Build Status
  4. CORRECTION: 7-Layer God View ↔ 13-Layer SAFE Mapping
  5. CORRECTION: MAESTRO Deep Details Missing from Initial Note
  6. VERIFICATION: Build Status Cross-Reference Confirmed
  7. CORRECTION: EGL Convergence Is REAL — Not Hallucination Noise
  8. HLF v0.4.0 Delta Analysis — Comprehensive Build Status
  9. RESOLVED: v0.4.0 Syntax Diff + HLF Memory Nodes Build Status
- **User's own notes also present** (Evolutionary Architecture, Hieroglyphic Logic Framework, Multi-Agent Safety, Ancient Logic, Architectural Foundations, Unbiased Search Protocol)

### SAFE v4.0 Blueprint (297 sources)
- Use for deep technical queries about the 13-layer architecture, MAESTRO, ETHOS/SBTs, EGL, DGM
- Contains the Springer book "Securing AI Agents" as a source

## 4. Versioning Clarification (CRITICAL)

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| HLF v3.0 | The language SPECIFICATION (RFC 9005) |
| v0.4.0 | The COMPILER implementation version |
| SAFE v4.0 | The 13-layer ARCHITECTURE specification (separate) |
| "HLF 4.0" | Does NOT formally exist — user means v0.4.0 compiler |

---

## 5. What's Built vs. Not Built (Summary)

### ✅ FULLY BUILT
- 13 statement types, all RFC 9005/9007 operators
- 4-pass compiler (parse → env → ALIGN → dictionary)
- InsAIts V2 human_readable on every AST node
- 6-gate security pipeline (all gates operational)
- Runtime interpreter with gas metering (639 lines)
- Host function dispatcher (305 lines, 12 live functions incl. z.AI τ() calls)
- Toolchain: hlfc, hlffmt, hlflint, benchmarks, metrics, pre-commit
- All governance configs: hls.yaml, dictionary.json, ALIGN_LEDGER, host_functions.json (v1.1.0)
- 14-Hat Aegis-Nexus Engine (14 named agents + Weaver meta-agent)

### 🟡 CONFIGURED / STUB
- `bytecode_spec.yaml` — spec exists, bytecode VM implemented (stack-machine)
- `kya_init.sh` — self-signed certs, not real SPIFFE/SPIRE

- OpenClaw Strategy B — `openclaw_strategies.yaml` exists

- User has strong opinions about the hieroglyphic design foundations — they ARE the core philosophy, not branding
- User wants multi-pass verification (splicing good from bad across sessions)
- User categorizes features by tier: Home, Hobbyist, Freelancer, Enterprise
- User steers research actively via notebook notes — always read their latest notes first
- The user built the HLF v0.4.0 features partially via Copilot diffs — some landed, some didn't (hence broken tests)
- Use `npm run preflight` for comprehensive checks
